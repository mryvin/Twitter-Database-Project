# Twitter-Database-Project

In this repository, please find the code submission for the database project. The project code is submitted in two forms. 

First, the jupyter notebook within the root directory contains a sample of the code that is suitable to run to see the logic and the time of search queries. However, the directory "app" contains the files needed to run the program from its commmand line application.

## App Files
Within the `app` directory, there are several files. The first is the `Search Application` Python script. This code contains all the elements needed to start the application; this script should be run to interact with the search functionality. Within this file, we interact with the user via the command line, collect inputs and make calls to appropriate search functions within their appropriate utilities, present results in a visually understandable way, and allow the user to issue follow-up requests.

## Databases Used

This database project utilizes both mysql and nosql in order to showcase both relational and nonrelational databases. MySQL data was stored in MySQL server and NoSQL data was stored on MongoDB
